<!-- retired 2026-09-30: spent. Witnessed: the acknowledged-base live nerve and its delta-chunking evolution are on canonical main (#99, #100, #101); display live nerve on main passed test and deploy (run 36055518680, 2026-09-24; run 36237195493, 2026-09-26); the regression witness passes locally on current main; the Papers digest of 2026-09-27 records the live chain running end to end. The blocked-promotion response already sits in papers/_waste. Not witnessed here: the provider (Cloudflare) post-state naming the deployed revision, and whether the Apps Script producer performs the >1 MiB chunking. -->

# REQUEST — canonical Display live-nerve promotion order

status: OPEN / FOREIGN CHILD REQUEST
kind: child→host dependency request + UPLINK
source_organism: github.cambium → display.papers
source_home_event: display-papers-source-mirror-ready-20260919T212903Z
target_organism: github.cambium → display
target_dependency: x/live / canonical production carrier

## admitted child consequence

Both ends of the new acknowledged-base protocol are now source-witnessed **as source code/mirrors**, but only the Display destination has executable staging regression witness.

Destination staging:
- generic Worker contract materialized under `w/display/x/live`;
- GitHub Actions run `35469101959` test SUCCESS;
- staging deploy correctly SKIPPED.

Source:
- Drive `/papers/_feed.gs` source mirror evolved in place and regression-witnessed;
- bound Apps-Script runtime remains unchanged because the connected substrate exposes no lawful bound-project deployment action.

## ordering pressure

The new source producer must not be deployed against the old production Worker.

Safe order is:
1. canonical destination Worker first;
2. bound source runtime second;
3. acknowledged-base bootstrap/reconciliation;
4. actual changed-unit and failure/recovery witnesses;
5. static visitor read witness.

## requested Display decision

Decide whether the already-tested generic live-nerve change is ready for **deliberate canonical promotion/deployment**.

Promotion must remain bounded to the affected production dependency cone. Do **not** blindly promote unrelated staging history merely because `QuantumCephalopod/cambium:main` contains newer organism work.

The live-nerve implementation/witness set is:
- `w/display/x/live/src/index.js`;
- `w/display/x/live/test.mjs`;
- `w/display/x/live/README.md`;
- `.github/workflows/cloudflare-live.yml`.

The target canonical carrier is `self-similar-systems/cambium`. Its current state must be compared against staging before any mutation. Preserve any independent canonical changes.

## acceptance boundary

A canonical promotion act may close only when:
- exact affected source bytes are reconciled against current canonical state;
- live-nerve regression witness passes on the canonical commit;
- canonical deploy job actually succeeds;
- provider post-state identifies the deployed canonical revision;
- no unrelated staging tissue is silently imported;
- no claim is made that source runtime/end-to-end circulation is thereby closed.

## return

Return the canonical deployment witness or the smallest blocker to `display.papers/_stomach`.

This request is production pressure, not automatic merge authority derived from filesystem ancestry.


## promotion attempt — 2026-09-19 · provider membrane blocked

### earned preflight
- A surgical promotion branch was created in the writable fork directly from canonical parent `5c6978a19ded9b406e27e34f9d81fc0bb5224b3b`.
- The promotion commit `48cc52b7bbbf52b6afa6a09d39dbf5fd74eeedee` changes exactly the four admitted live-nerve carriers and no other file:
  - `w/display/x/live/src/index.js`
  - `w/display/x/live/test.mjs`
  - `w/display/x/live/README.md`
  - `.github/workflows/cloudflare-live.yml`
- GitHub Actions run `35471086651` executed that exact commit on branch `mnemos/canonical-live-nerve-promotion-20260919`.
- Test job: SUCCESS.
- Deploy job: SKIPPED, as required outside canonical `self-similar-systems/cambium:main`.

### exact blocker
The connected GitHub integration can read `self-similar-systems/cambium` but cannot mutate it:
- creating an upstream branch returned HTTP 403 `Resource not accessible by integration`;
- creating an upstream pull request from the prepared fork branch returned the same HTTP 403.

No canonical ref, pull request, commit or deployment was changed by this attempt.

### resumption witness
The prepared surgical source remains available in the writable fork:
- branch: `mnemos/canonical-live-nerve-promotion-20260919`
- commit: `48cc52b7bbbf52b6afa6a09d39dbf5fd74eeedee`
- exact canonical parent: `5c6978a19ded9b406e27e34f9d81fc0bb5224b3b`
- provider preflight: `display live nerve` run `35471086651` SUCCESS.

This request remains OPEN. The smallest unresolved dependency is canonical repository write/PR authority. Once that membrane is writable, re-check canonical `main` before promotion; do not assume the parent remained current.


## production re-entry — 2026-09-24 · delta-chunking deploy blocked by test-shape mismatch

### provider witness
Canonical `self-similar-systems/cambium:main` advanced beyond the 2026-09-19 authority blocker and now contains the acknowledged-base live nerve plus the later delta-chunking evolution.

Canonical commit `c5cf5b415aafbe0c783e29dbd1209d7fa684093d` triggered `display live nerve` run `36024444316`.
- test job: **FAILURE**
- deploy job: **SKIPPED**
- failing step: `Witness live nerve`
- exact failure: Node strict deep equality compared an ordinary JSON object returned as `unit_revisions` with an otherwise value-identical null-prototype object produced by the test helper `revisionLedger()`.

The failure does **not** witness a transport-law mismatch. The reported maps contained the same keys and SHA-256 revisions; only their JavaScript prototypes differed.

### bounded repair
Normalize the expected ledger to the JSON-shaped plain-object boundary before comparison. Do not change Worker packet grammar, revision derivation, R2 mutation semantics, source Papers physiology, or the acknowledged-base contract.

### acceptance
- current live-nerve test passes on a branch rooted at the current canonical HEAD;
- resulting upstream PR changes only the test witness plus this open-request evidence unless another independently witnessed dependency is required;
- canonical production deployment remains OPEN until the repaired canonical workflow actually succeeds.


## bounded repair witness — 2026-09-24

Fork branch `mnemos/live-ledger-prototype-witness-20260924` was rooted directly at current canonical HEAD `9887db14930496df08960341ecffe3507b405434`.

Differential provider witness:
- unmodified current canonical base on the fork branch → `display live nerve` run `36053840908` **FAILURE** on the same prototype-sensitive ledger assertion;
- repaired branch head `f657d7fcb24be7f659eef1c3a2634fce4c977ff8` → `display live nerve` run `36053899399` **SUCCESS**;
- executable change: one assertion only, normalizing the null-prototype expected ledger to an ordinary JSON-shaped object before equality comparison.

The repair therefore closes the staging/fork regression witness without changing transport semantics.

Canonical promotion remains OPEN: creating the upstream pull request from the prepared fork branch again returned HTTP 403 `Resource not accessible by integration`. No canonical ref or production Worker changed in this act.

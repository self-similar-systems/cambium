# NUTRIENT — public Git history remediation — 2026-10-02

status: OPEN / ADMITTED
source: Philipp, chat 2026-10-02
target: github.cambium → display → crawlerbait
kind: destructive publication-boundary remediation

## encounter

The current Crawlerbait privacy membrane is now technically current-tree safe, but earlier public Git history still carries richer traffic material from before the privacy corrections.

Philipp explicitly requests that this historical exposure now be remediated as well.

## witnessed current state

Authoritative main has already completed and deployed the current-tree privacy migration:
- query is not captured;
- literal IP, network recognition and exact User-Agent are absent from current public Traces;
- arbitrary unoffered request paths cross `crawlerbait:path:v1`;
- legacy 404 evidence was coalesced with exact counts preserved;
- readable legacy UA carriers were retired from the current tree.

## historical exposure requiring separate treatment

Earlier reachable commits include:
- full v4 traffic carriers with public `clientIPIdentity`, exact `userAgent`, `clientRequestQuery`, raw `clientRequestPath` and broad readable Cloudflare dimensions;
- legacy checkpoint / capture / retained-bootstrap carriers with exact User-Agent strings and raw requested paths;
- derived historical Crawlerbait state/public surfaces that may repeat those values.

The full-raw v4 lineage is reachable from all currently surviving authoritative organization branches and from the public QuantumCephalopod fork through multiple refs.

## governing boundary

This is a history rewrite, not an ordinary semantic mutation.

Do not:
- rewrite only `main` while other refs keep the exposed objects reachable;
- preserve a public backup ref containing the old objects;
- delete unrelated Crawlerbait law/code history merely because its derived data carriers are sensitive;
- claim deletion from third-party clones/caches that are outside repository control;
- force-update public refs before a rewritten mirror has passed content and current-tree equality witnesses.

## candidate rewrite strategy

Rewrite all controlled refs with `git-filter-repo --sensitive-data-removal`, removing historical Crawlerbait data/state carriers that can hold source-derived request material:

- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/w/**`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/x/captures/**`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/x/checkpoint.json`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/x/cursor.json`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/x/state.json`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/x/retained-bootstrap/**`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/z/projection.json`
- `w/display/y/yw/crawlerbait/z/public/**`

Then reintroduce the exact current sanitized versions of those carriers from current authoritative main as one post-rewrite current-state commit. This preserves current function while preventing older readable snapshots from remaining in rewritten history.

Before force-update:
- enumerate changed refs and affected PR refs;
- verify no open PR exists;
- verify rewritten current worktree is byte-identical to authoritative current main;
- scan rewritten history for known forbidden carrier paths/content;
- verify current build/tests against the rewritten main;
- preserve an offline/private audit map of old→new commit identities rather than a public old-history branch.

After controlled ref replacement:
- rewrite/delete corresponding refs in the sole public fork;
- request GitHub Support cache / pull-request-ref cleanup if needed;
- document that unrelated third-party clones, if any, cannot be remotely erased.

## acceptance

Close only when:
1. rewritten mirror passes all structural/display/Crawlerbait witnesses;
2. current sanitized tree matches pre-rewrite authoritative main byte-for-byte;
3. all controlled public branch/tag refs no longer reach the removed historical carriers;
4. the public QuantumCephalopod fork no longer reaches them through its retained refs;
5. affected GitHub PR/cached-view residue is enumerated and either cleared or explicitly pending provider support;
6. no public rollback/archive ref preserves the old exposed graph;
7. truthful HOME records new commit-identity boundary and remaining uncontrollable copies.
